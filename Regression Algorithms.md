# Regression Algorithms Break Down

### Simple Linear Regression:

Minimizing the mean squared error

Use:Simple linear relationships

Pros | Cons
------------ | -------------
Works on any size of dataset, given informations about relevance of features | Assumes linearity


### Multiple Linear Regression: 

Increasing the feature/dimension of the simple linear regression

Pros | Cons
------------ | -------------
Same as Linear Reg | Assumes linearity

### Polynomial Regression

Introduce no linearity into the picture

Use: non linear simple relationships

Pros | Cons
------------ | -------------
better fit for non linear functions | choosing the right degree for the best fit to prevent overfitting is of crucial importance

### Support Vector Regression

try to fit as many instances of the data set as possible while limiting margin violations

Use: ? need more in depth research

Pros | Cons
------------ | -------------
