1. The idea of machine learning itself is kind of ill posed
2. Assumptions must be made

Bias - Variance Trade-off (Overfitting and Underfitting)

Decision Tree- a greedy algorithm - important thing is: Arriving at a impurity function that improve the accuracy of the classifier(this turns out to be a inverted parabolic function)

The Machine Learning Process: 

Using Pandas - import the dataframe
Labeling and cleaning using NumPy - split into training data and testing data.
From a high level, use Scikit Learn library to train a model (Parameter Adjustments must be made for specific cases)
