# ML-Notes
This document is used to document my learning journey 

First Education Video on Computer Vision - Learning to See(Welch Labs): 2 hours

1. The idea of machine learning itself is kind of ill posed
2. Assumptions must be made
3. How you find the data and how you arrive at the assumptions to optimize the model is the most important thing 

Bias - Variance Trade-off (Overfitting and Underfitting)

Decision Tree- a greedy algorithm - important thing is: Arriving at a impurity function that improve the accuracy of the classifier(this turns out to be a inverted parabolic function)

The Machine Learning Process: 

Using Pandas - import the dataframe
Labeling and cleaning using NumPy - split into training data and testing data.
From a high level, use Scikit Learn library to train a model (Parameter Adjustments must be made for specific cases)

Three Blue One Brown Machine Learning Serie - Deep Learning Introduction: 2 hours or so

Convolutional Neural Network - good for image recognition 
Long-short term memory network - good for NLP

Introduction Variant - Vanilla: Multilayer Perceptron
  - Inlcudeds 
    Neurons, neurons are activated by some input, each neuron path way have a weight - transform inputs by sigmoid(compressing the number line from one to zero)
  - Bias, a set value to offset the sigmoid activation function of each neuron, all this can be represented by a matrix multiplication as well as addition
